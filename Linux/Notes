-------------------------------------------------			
14. SSH(SECURE SHELL) COMMANDS
	SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that enables secure remote connections between two systems. System admins use SSH utilities to manage machines, copy, or move files between systems. Because SSH transmits data over encrypted channels, security is at a high level.

		** How to find public IPaddress
			The public IP address is what websites and services see when you access them from your computer. If you want to try to connect to your computer via a remote connection that isn't on the same network, you'll need the public IP address.
				$ curl ifconfig.me
		** How to find private IPaddress
			If we are trying to find the IP address of our computer within our Wi-Fi network we 
			will need to know the IP address.		
				$ ifconfig
			Then we will get the Private IPaddress	
				172.17.0.1
			Now we can copy our any file into a directory using scp command
				scp new.txt gunjan@172.17.0.1:~/work_Dir	

		**Sending copy of a file to another IPaddress within same network connection
				scp new.txt beryl@192.168.1.28:~/training/	
		
		1.How to access Remote server?
			We can connect to remote machine usung IPAddress or name
			IPaddress   -   ssh 192.168.56.101
			Name        -   ssh test.server.com

		2.Specify username for SSh Connection
			SSH uses current user when accessing remote server
			Syntax - ssh username@hostname_or_ip
			Ex     - ssh testuser@10.0.0.35

		3.Use different portnumber for ssh connection	
			By default port number is 22. If the portnumber setting in ssh config is changed then it give an error so we use -p commannd:-
						EX - ssh test.server.com -p 3322 

		4.Generate ssh keys using ssh keygen
			To improve the security of SSH connections, generate a key pair with the keygen utility. The pair consists of a public and private key. The public key can be shared, while the private key needs to stay secure.

			SSH key pairs are used to authenticate clients to servers automatically. When you create an SSH key pair, there is no longer a need to enter a password to access a server.				
			Use these commands on host machine terminal to generate key pairs:-
			 	ssh -keygen -t rsa

		5.Copy public ssh key
			To use key pair for ssh authetication,you need to copy the public key to server. The key is the file id_rsa.pub in previously defined with ssh keygen utility.

			To copy key to the server, run the command from the client:-
				ssh-copy-id hostname_or_ip

			Enter the password to authenticate when asked. After this, you will no longer need to use the password to connect to the same server.	

-------------------------------------
15.SCP(SECURE COPY) COMMANDS
	SCP (Secure Copy) is command line tool in Linux and Unix like systems which is used to transfer files and directories across the systems securely over the network. When we use scp command to copy files and directories from our local system to remote system then in the backend it makes ssh connection to remote system. In other words, we can say scp uses the same SSH security mechanism in the backend, it needs either password or keys for authentication.	

		1. scp < options > < files or directories > user@target_host:/< folder >
		2. scp < options > user@target_host:/files < folder_local_system >

		First command tells how files or directoris are copied from local system to target host under a specific folder.
		Second command tells how files from target host is copied into local system.

		Various options that are used are:-
		-C - Enable Compression
		-i - Idetify file or private key
		-l - limit the bandwidth while copying
		-P - ssh port number of target host
		-p - preserves permissions,modes and access time of files while coping
		-q - suppress warning message of ssh
		-r - copy files and directories recursively
		-v - verbose output

		1. Copy a file from local system to remote system using scp
			we want to copy jdk rpm package from our local Linux system to remote system (172.20.10.8) using scp command

			scp jdk-linux-x64_bin.rpm root@172.20.10.8:/opt
			root@172.20.10.8's password:
			jdk-linux-x64_bin.rpm                          100%   10MB  27.1MB/s   00:00

			This command will copy jdk rpm package file to remote system under /opt folder.

		2. Copy a file from remote system to local system using scp
			we want to copy a file from remote system to our local system under the /tmp folder

			scp root@172.20.10.8:/root/name_of_the_file.odt /tmp
			
			ls -l /tmp/Technical-Doc-RHS.odt
			-rwx------. 1 pkumar pkumar 1135521 Oct 19 11:12 /tmp/Technical-Doc-RHS.odt

		3. Verbose output while transferring files using scp(-v)
			In scp command, we can enable the verbose output using -v option, using verbose output we can easily find what exactly is happening in the background. This becomes very useful in debugging connection, authentication and configuration problems.

			scp -v jdk_linux_-x64_bin.rmp root@172.20.10.8:/opt

			Executing: program /usr/bin/ssh host 172.20.10.8, user root, command scp -v -t /opt
			OpenSSH_7.8p1, OpenSSL 1.1.1 FIPS  11 Sep 2018
			debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config
			debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/05-redhat.conf
			debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config
			debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/05-redhat.conf line 8: Applying options for *
			debug1: Connecting to 172.20.10.8 [172.20.10.8] port 22.
			debug1: Connection established.
			…………
			debug1: Next authentication method: password
			root@172.20.10.8's password:

		4. Transfer multiple files to remote host

			scp index.html install.txt keyvalue.txt root@172.20.10.8:/opt

			root@172.20.10.8's password:
			install.txt                                      100%    0     0.0KB/s   00:00
			index.html                                       100%   85KB   7.2MB/s   00:00
			jdk-linux-x64_bin.rpm                            100%   10MB  25.3MB/s   00:00	

		5. Transfer files across two remote hosts
			Using scp command we can copy files and directories between two remote hosts, let’s suppose we have a local Linux system which can connect to two remote Linux systems, so from my local linux system I can use scp command to copy files across these two systems.
			
			Syntax: scp user@remote_host1:/< file_to_transfer> user@remote_host2:/< folder >
			Ex: scp gunjan@172.20.10.9:/index.zip root@172.20.10.8:/tmp
				ssh root@172.20.10.8 "ls -l /tmp/index.zip"
				-rwx------. 1 root root 747438080 Oct 19 12:02 /tmp/backup-Oct.zip

		6. Copy files and directories recursively(-r)
			Use -r option in scp command to recursively copy the entire directory from one system to another.

			scp -r Downloads root@172.20.10.8:/opt 		

			To check whether folder is copied to remote system or not,

			ssh root@172.20.10.8 "ls -ld /opt/Downloads"
			drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 75 Oct 19 12:10 /opt/Downloads

		7. Incresing transfer speed by enabling compression (-C)
			In scp command, we can increase the transfer speed by enabling the compression using -C option, it will automatically enable compression at source and decompression at destination host.

			scp -r -C Downloads root@172.20.10.8:/opt 	

		8. Limit bandwidth while copying(-l)
			Use ‘-l’ option in scp command to put limit on bandwidth usage while copying. Bandwidth is specified in Kbit/s.

			scp -l 500 index.html root@172.20.10.8:/opt
    
		9. Specify different ssh port while scp(-P)
		    In case when ssh port is changed , so while using scp command we can specify port number using -P command.

			scp -P 3322 index.html root@172.20.10.8:/tmp

		10. Preserves permissions,modes,access time of files while copying(-p)
			 Use “-p” option in scp command to preserve permissions, access time and modes while copying from source to destination.

			 scp -p userfile.txt root@172.20.10.8:/opt

		11. Transferring files in quiet mode(-q) in scp
			 Use ‘-q’ option in scp command to suppress transfer progress, warning and diagnostic messages of ssh.

			 $ scp -q -r downloads root@172.20.10.8:/var/temp

		12. Use identify key while tranferring(-i)
			In most of the linux environments,keys-based authetication is preferred.In scp we use '-i' option to specify private key file and identify file.

			 $ Scp -i my_key.pem downloads root@172.20.10.8:/temp

		13. Use different 'ssh-config' file in scp(-F)
			In many cases we use differnet network to connect to linux systems,may be some networks are behind proxy servers,so in that case we must have different ssh_config file.

			$ scp -F /home/gunjan/new_ssh_config -r downloads root@172.0.0.8:/root

		14. Use different cipher in scp command(-c)
			 By default, scp uses ‘AES-128’ cipher to encrypt the files. If you want to use another cipher in scp command then use ‘-c’ option followed by cipher name.
             Let’s suppose we want to use ‘3des-cbc’ cipher in scp command while transferring the files	 	  	  
			  	 	
			  $ scp -c 3des-cbc -r Downloads root@172.20.10.8:/root	 	

-------------------------------------			  
16. COPY FILE AND DIRECTORIES COMMANDS

		1. cp project/mail.txt projectbackup/new_mail.txt - Copies mail.txt file contents to new_mail.txt file.
		2. cp project/mail.txt projectbackup/ - copies mail.txt file to directory projectbackup with same name.
		3. cp index1.txt index2.txt index.txt projectbackup/ - copies multiple file 
		4. cp *.txt projectbackup/ - copies all files with .txt extension
		5. cp bin /home/beryl/projectbackup/ - copies bin directories with its files and sub
		   directories in projectbackup directory with same name.
		6. cp -RT bin /home/beryl/projectbackup/ - If destination dir. already exits then it copies only subdirectories and files without coping target directory.
		7. cp --backup readme.txt /home/beryl/projectbackup/ - This will backup all the data of readme.txt file in projectbackup directory with readme.txt~ filename.
		8. cp -i index.html /home/beryl/projectbackup/ - Prompts before overwriting 
		9. cp --attributes-only --preserve file2 file1 - preserves attributes like date month time etc.
		10. cp -n readme.txt cp ~/projectbackup/ - Forcefully stops overwriting.

----------------------------------------		
17. GREP COMMANDS (GLOBALLY SEARCH FOR REGULAR EXPRESSION AND PATTERNS)
	The grep filter searches a file for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern. 
		
		1.Case insensitive search- $ grep -i "UNix" New.txt
		2.Displaying the count of number of matches- $ grep -c "unix" new.txt
		3.Display the file names that matches the pattern- 
			$grep -l "unix" *
		4.Checking for the whole words in a file - By default, grep matches the given string/pattern even if it found as a substring in a file.
		    $ grep -w "unix" new.txt
		5.Displaying only the matched pattern - $ grep -o "unix" new.txt
		6.Show line number while displaying the output using grep -n -
		    $ grep -n "unix" new.txt
		7.Inverting the pattern match : we can display the lines that are not matched     
			$ grep -v "unix" new.txt
		8. Matching the lines that start with a string - $ grep "^unix" new.txt	
		9. Matching the lines that end with a string - $ grep "os$" new.txt

-------------------------------------------
18. VI EDITOR
		-The vi editor is the most popular and commonly used Linux text editor
		-It is usually available in all Linux Distributions.
		-It works in two modes, Command and Insert
		-Command mode takes the user commands, and the Insert mode is for editing text

		-vi simplefile
		-i - insert data
		-:wq - to save and exit
		-cat simplefile - shows the content
		-vi -R simplefile - opens only in read only mode
