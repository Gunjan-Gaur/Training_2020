GIT COMMANDS
--------------------------------------

 Make a git repository which is empty.
-------------------------------------
Cloning:-
	2. Copy your git repository and add files. We have space to add files ,we need a way to get it from our local system.To set that, we need to copy repo. to our system.Git refers to copying a repository as cloning.When we clone a repo. we create a connection b/w server and local system.
		$ cd
		$ mkdir repos
		$ cd repos
		$ git clone http://......
		$ ls
		  Extra (Repository inside repository)

	In cloning we clone all the versions or commits of project while in downloading only the last final version of project is used.	  
---------------------------------------
Adding files into local repository and put it into main repository on our github repository:-
	$ cd ~/repos/Extra
	
	$ echo "Extra file" >> temp.txt  OR  (echo "Extra file" >> README.md)
	
	$ git status
	
	NOTE:- In this case we have cloned repository and adding files to it. when we have to initialize git and want to nake repository the we first use-- git init
	
	$ git add temp.txt :- The git add command moves changes from the working directory to the Git
	                      staging area. The staging area is where you prepare a snapshot of a set of changes before committing them to the official history.
	
	$ git commit -m "Adding First File":- The git commit takes the staged snapshot and commits it
										  to the project history. Combined with git add, this process defines the basic workflow for all Git users.

	$  git push origin master :- This command specifies that you are pushing to the master branch.

----------------------------------------
Pull changes from remote repository: we need to get new file or edited from repository.
	$ git pull --all:- The git pull command merges the file from your remote repository into your 
	                   local repository with a single command.

---------------------------------------
Branching
 	Branches are most powerful when we are working on a team. We can work on our own part of a project from our own branch, pull updates , and then merge all our work into the main branch when it's ready. A branch is a brand new directory, staging area and project history.Branches are pointers to commit.

 	$ cd ~/repos/Extra

 	$ git branch New - Makes a new branch

 	$ git checkout New - Checkout command work in hand-in-hand.Everytime we make a new branch we make sure to check it out to use it.

 	NOTE:-We can add new file to branch or edit old one.

 	$ git add sample.txt

 	$ git commit -m "Editing sample.txt"

 	$ git push origin branch

 	When we want to merge our branch to the origin branch

 	$ git checkout master

 	$ git merge branch

 	$ git branch -d branch

 	$ git push origin master

 	Important-Note:- If we want to merge 2 branches and we have modified same file of both the branches the merge conflict occurs. Then we have to resolve this conflict by selecting one file text 

 	git commit -i main.txt

----------------------------------------
